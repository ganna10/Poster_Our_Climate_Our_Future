        \begin{itemize}
            \item More explicit mechanisms have larger \ce{O_x} production than less explicit mechanisms. \vspace{10mm}
            \item VOCs break down into smaller fragments quicker in less-explicit mechanisms resulting in less \ce{O_3} production. \vspace{10mm} 
            \item The first day \ce{O3} production similar between many mechanisms, larger differences over time. \vspace{10mm}
            \item Differences in VOC degradation products can impact on \ce{O3} production -- RACM aromatic chemistry. \vspace{10mm}
