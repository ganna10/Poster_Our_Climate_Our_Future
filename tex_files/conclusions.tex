        \begin{itemize}
            \item Near-explicit mechanisms produce more \ce{O_x} than less-explicit mechanisms. \vspace{10mm}
            \item VOCs broken down into smaller fragments quicker in less-explicit mechanisms resulting in less \ce{O_x} production. \vspace{10mm} 
            \item First day \ce{O_x} production from VOCs similar between many mechanisms, larger differences over time. \vspace{10mm}
            \item Differences in VOC degradation treatments impacts \ce{O_x} production -- RACM aromatic chemistry. \vspace{10mm}
